            Participant Agreement Waiver, Release &amp; Assumption of Risk Form
          </div>
          Everyone who signs on the Waiver Form must submit his/her Age Proof
          ID. If the participant is under the age of 18, a parent or legal
          guardian must sign the waiver for them and submit their Age Proof ID.
          YooHoo: The Trampoline Park entails certain risks that simply cannot
          be eliminated without jeopardizing the park&apos;s overall experience
          and essential qualities of its activities. Risks include the
          negligence of other participants or yourself, injuries including rope
          burns, sprains, fractures, scrapes, bruises and cuts, joint
          dislocations, pinched fingers and serious injuries to head, back or
          neck which can cause paralysis or even death. Participants often fall
          from the equipment, sprain, or break wrist, ankles &amp; legs and can
          suffer more serious injury as well. Participants often fall on each
          other resulting in broken bones and other serious injuries. Double
          bouncing, more than one person per trampoline can create a rebound
          effect causing serious injury. In any event, if you or your child is
          injured, you or your child may require medical assistance, at your own
          expense. Furthermore, YooHoo employees have extremely difficult and
          high-risk jobs to perform. They seek safety but they are not
          infallible, they might be unaware of a participant&apos;s health
          issues or abilities. They may give incomplete warnings or instructions
          and the equipment being used might malfunction in rare cases. I have
          had sufficient opportunity to read this document.:
